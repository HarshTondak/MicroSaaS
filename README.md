# Objective

Recreate microsaascapital.com using NextJS.

- Make sure it works as a static export: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports

- Add a dark-mode/light-mode toggle which you can design however you want.

- Add a ‚ÄúBlog‚Äù page (landing page for blog posts) which you can design however you want. Use a lorem ipsum generator for content. You don‚Äôt need to design the individual blog post view (just the blog landing page which contains multiple posts).

- Optional: Improve the design of the current landing page.

## Solution

- The assignment is done using `Next.js`.
- Redesigned the website to look minimal as well as beautiful.
- Added dark-mode/light-mode functionality. It first takes the system theme preference.
- Created a Blog Landing page showing all the required information.
- It is working properly for static export.
- This website is completely responsive for all screen sizes.
